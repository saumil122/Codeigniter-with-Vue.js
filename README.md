# Codeigniter-with-Vue.js
Small scale shopping cart example with Codeigniter 3 (Backend) and Vue.js &amp; Bootstrap (front end)

# Objective:

In Shopping cart application, Admin can manage category, product, user and orders.
There end-user or visitor has to login first to make the order from the site.
In this application, I have used Codeigniter (Version 3) for backend process. Along side this, I have used Bootstrap 4, "open-iconic" Bootstrap Icons and Vue.js for the frontend part.
   
# Benefits:

- The admin can easily manage Categories and Product through CRUD operation.
- The admin can also manage the users through CRUD operation.
- The admin can see the list of orders. (But all orders are generated as pending status for now.)

# Prerequisite:

- PHP
- Apache
- MySQL
